# Project Continuity Log

## Purpose

This is the operational memory and handoff file for the Prostate Lab Trajectories project. It complements, but does not replace, `RESEARCH_LOG.md`.

Use this file to preserve:

- What happened in each working session.
- What was verified and what remains an assumption.
- What the user must be reminded to do.
- Current access, storage and browser blockers.
- Exact next actions and their order.
- Decisions that a future agent must not silently reverse.
- Links to the detailed evidence and implementation files.

Every agent continuing this project must read this file first, then read `RESEARCH_LOG.md`, `README.md` and the relevant documents listed in the onboarding order below.

## Maintenance rules

1. Update the Current snapshot whenever the active blocker or next action changes.
2. Add a dated session entry after every meaningful action, discovery, failure, user decision or approval.
3. Put methodological decisions in `RESEARCH_LOG.md` as well as summarizing them here.
4. Never put passwords, login codes, private download links, patient identifiers or patient values in this file.
5. Clearly label facts as verified, pending, inferred or blocked.
6. Never report a download, file inspection or test as completed without direct evidence.
7. Keep raw and restricted data outside Git.
8. Do not use em dashes in project files or user-facing responses.

## Current snapshot

**Last updated:** 2026-08-27

**Project stage:** Restricted package secured in approved private Google Cloud Storage; protected real-file audit pending approval

**Primary source:** Project Data Sphere Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge

**Current dataset page:** `https://data.projectdatasphere.org/projectdatasphere/html/content/0abbd47a-dcfb-42c2-a036-af1898ea3c1c`

**Current dataset ID:** `Prostat_na_2006_149`

**Current storage state:** Craig at PDS confirmed that private Google Cloud storage is permitted. The unchanged package is stored in a dedicated private bucket in the Netherlands region. The two verified local restricted ZIP copies were permanently removed after cloud verification and fresh user confirmation.

**Immediate blocker:** Google Cloud Storage stores the package but does not run the audit. A protected Google Cloud computing environment must be selected, costed, created with private access controls and approved by the user before the restricted package is extracted or inspected.

**Immediate next action:** Explain the protected cloud-computing plan and costs, then obtain explicit approval before creating computing resources or beginning the real-file audit.

**After approval:** Create or use an approved private computing environment, extract only inside protected storage, inspect every dictionary sheet, run the synthetic tests and aggregate inventory, check the report for privacy, and stop for user approval before writing cleaning transformations.

## User communication requirements

- Use simple, non-medical language first.
- Explain why a step is necessary before starting a new major stage.
- Ask for approval when a new major stage or consequential choice begins.
- Give brief summaries of what was done, reached, learned and planned.
- Do not use em dashes.
- Do not overwhelm the user with unexplained medical or statistical terms.
- If technical terms are necessary, define them immediately in everyday language.
- Remind the user of deferred tasks when their required situation arrives, especially the home download.

## Fixed research identity

### Research question

> Among patients with stage-IV metastatic prostate cancer receiving chemotherapy, how are serial pre-chemotherapy blood-test trajectories, individually and in combination, associated with survival, disease progression, treatment response and treatment tolerance, and how early can favorable or unfavorable patterns be detected?

### Non-negotiable scope

- This is not a PSA-only study.
- Analyze every blood-test value that repeats often enough to support a responsible analysis.
- Start with a narrow discovery group, then broaden, then validate independently.
- Do not restrict the project to one country or ethnicity.
- Treat results as associations unless causal evidence exists.
- Report positive, negative, null, contradictory and failed findings.

### Three-stage source strategy

1. **Discovery:** PDS DREAM training data from ASCENT2, MAINSAIL and VENICE.
2. **Controlled broadening:** CHAARTED/E3805, especially longitudinal PSA linked to survival and progression.
3. **Independent validation:** Vivli trials or Flatiron only after exact field availability is confirmed.

## Access and acquisition status

### Verified PDS approval state

- The PDS registration and data-access application was accepted on 2026-08-25.
- The user successfully signed in to PDS.
- The approved DREAM contribution is visible and marked Available for Download.
- The contribution contains 2,070 patients.
- The contribution page lists the complete file package, dictionary, training package, leaderboard package and final-scoring package.

### Verified PDS file listing

| Type | Filename | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| Complete package | `AllProvidedFiles_149.zip` | Secured and verified in private Google Cloud Storage; not extracted |
| Data dictionary | `Challenge_data_dictionary v2.xlsx` | Verified as a bundle member; not yet inspected |
| Training package | `prostate_cancer_challenge_data_training.zip` | Verified as a bundle member; not yet extracted |
| Leaderboard package | `prostate_cancer_challenge_data_leaderboard.zip` | Verified as a bundle member; not yet extracted |
| Final-scoring package | `prostate_cancer_challenge_data_finalscoringset.zip` | Verified as a bundle member; not yet extracted |
| CRF location document | `PCDC Protocol, CRF Location.docx` | Verified as a bundle member; not yet opened |

### Verified training files listed inside the package

- `CoreTable_training.csv`
- `LabValue_training.csv`
- `LesionMeasure_training.csv`
- `MedHistory_training.csv`
- `PriorMed_training.csv`
- `VitalSign_training.csv`
- `Challenge_data_dictionary v2.xlsx`

### Historical browser download issue and resolution

The correct page and Download controls were verified. Earlier automated attempts used the page's semantic link, visible DOM control and physical browser click, but no browser download event occurred at that time.

This blocker was resolved on 2026-08-27. The user downloaded the complete package, it passed local integrity and ZIP path checks, Craig approved private Google Cloud storage, and the unchanged bytes were uploaded and verified there. The local restricted copies were removed only after complete cloud verification.

## Storage and privacy rules

### Verified private Google Cloud storage

- PDS approval for private Google Cloud storage was confirmed by the user on 2026-08-27.
- Google Cloud project: `pds-dream-secure-storage`.
- Private bucket: `pds-dream-secure-storage-eu-20260827`.
- Bucket location: `europe-west4`, Netherlands.
- Object: `gs://pds-dream-secure-storage-eu-20260827/prostate-lab-trajectories/data/raw/pds_dream/source/AllProvidedFiles_149 (1).zip`.
- Object size: 6,227,480 bytes.
- SHA-256: `AB3ECA19C5D0CC4106C96AC04E665DD1A5C9DF58F66328ECD24E8E1067932391`.
- MD5: `D4Yz5HS1gTF8tm8Xg6hK2A==` in Google Cloud metadata, matching local MD5 hex `0F8633E474B581317CB66F1783A84AD8`.
- CRC32C in Google Cloud metadata: `gx71ow==`.
- Public Access Prevention is enforced and Uniform Bucket-Level Access is enabled.
- No public principals were found. Access is through the approved project identity.
- Encryption uses Google-managed encryption keys.
- Object versioning is off. Soft delete is enabled for seven days. No retention policy or lifecycle deletion rule was added.
- Metadata-only authorized access was tested successfully. No patient row or laboratory value was displayed.
- The earlier empty United States multi-region bucket `pds-dream-secure-storage-raw-20260827` was deleted after explicit authorization.

### Verified local restricted-file cleanup

- Two identical restricted ZIP copies were found in the Windows Downloads folder.
- Both copies matched the verified cloud object size and MD5, and both had the expected SHA-256.
- Exact files removed permanently after fresh confirmation:
  - `C:\Users\BarbarosIsikGreenhou\Downloads\AllProvidedFiles_149 (1).zip`
  - `C:\Users\BarbarosIsikGreenhou\Downloads\AllProvidedFiles_149.zip`
- A fresh targeted Downloads scan found no remaining matching dataset files, extraction folders or partial browser downloads.
- Ordinary deletion on an SSD cannot guarantee forensic erasure because SSD wear-leveling may retain inaccessible physical remnants.
- No extraction occurred on this computer.

### Required rules

- Never commit patient-level or restricted data to GitHub.
- Never paste patient rows into chat, logs, issues, commits or public documents.
- Never upload the package to ordinary cloud storage without first confirming the PDS terms permit it and the destination is appropriately protected.
- Never expose passwords, security codes, SAS credentials, session cookies or private signed URLs.
- Keep the original package unchanged.
- Keep checksums and acquisition metadata separate from patient values.
- Commit only aggregated, disclosure-checked outputs when permitted.

### Preferred local layout after download

```text
data/
  raw/
    pds_dream/
      source/
        AllProvidedFiles_149.zip
      extracted/
  interim/
    pds_inventory.json
```

Both `data/raw/` and `data/interim/` are ignored by Git. Before moving or copying the downloaded package, verify the exact source and destination paths. Preserve the original ZIP.

### If the user's home computer lacks space

Follow this order:

1. Check the actual download size and available disk space.
2. Consider an encrypted external drive controlled by the user.
3. Consider the secure PDS SAS environment if the data-use agreement and workflow support analysis there.
4. Consider another institution-approved protected location only after confirming authorization.
5. Do not use a public link, shared personal drive or ordinary cloud folder merely for convenience.

## Work completed so far

### Repository and protocol foundation

- Created the private `prostate-lab-trajectories` repository.
- Fixed the research question and three-stage strategy.
- Created `README.md` and `RESEARCH_LOG.md`.
- Established privacy rules and ignored raw/restricted data paths.
- Preserved the user's instruction to study all sufficiently repeated blood tests.

### Literature foundation

- Curated 22 core and supporting studies.
- Created `literature/STUDY_CATALOG.md`.
- Created `literature/references.bib`.
- Created `literature/download_manifest.csv`.
- Downloaded and validated 10 full-text papers locally.
- Kept papers and extracted text outside Git.

### PDS public audit

- Located official PDS contribution `Prostat_na_2006_149`.
- Confirmed DOI `10.34949/e6c8-v326`.
- Located official Synapse project `syn2813558` and public documentation.
- Confirmed event-level training laboratory data through approximately day 84.
- Confirmed likely fields such as `LBDT_PC`, `LBBLFL`, `LBSTRESC`, `LBSTAT`, `LBNRIND` and `VISIT`.
- Confirmed public release table families and documented absent or unproven treatment-administration, adverse-event and progression event tables.

### Public CHAARTED audit

- Confirmed D8 is described as longitudinal PSA.
- Confirmed D5 contains survival and several progression outcomes.
- Confirmed D7 includes treatment data and PSA progression.
- Confirmed D9 contains chemotherapy total dose.
- Confirmed linked submissions use common identifier `group_uid`.
- Kept exact per-cycle administration timing as unverified.

### Public DREAM code audit

- Inspected the public winning-solution repository without treating it as patient data.
- Confirmed likely core outcome fields including `RPT`, `STUDYID`, `DEATH`, `LKADT_P`, `DISCONT`, `ENDTRS_C` and `ENTRT_PC`.
- Identified baseline laboratory clues including albumin, hemoglobin, PSA, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, ALT, AST, calcium, creatinine, neutrophils, platelets, bilirubin, testosterone, WBC, magnesium, phosphorus, total protein and RBC.
- Recorded that public code does not prove longitudinal coverage, source counts or actual treatment dates.

### Safe inventory tool

- Implemented `src/audit/inventory_raw_data.py` using Python standard-library code.
- The tool reads CSV files without changing them.
- The report contains table names, columns, row counts, missingness, recognized field coverage and aggregate repeated-lab counts.
- It does not write patient identifiers or laboratory result values to the report.
- It warns when no recognized actual chemotherapy administration date is found.
- Added synthetic CoreTable and LabValue fixtures with invented patients.
- Added three unit tests.
- All three tests passed on 2026-08-25.

## Repository and Git state

**Canonical project home:** `https://github.com/barbarosisik/prostate-lab-trajectories`

**Canonical branch:** `main`

**Current working copy:** `C:\Users\BarbarosIsikGreenhou\Desktop\prostate-lab-trajectories`.

**Verified state on 2026-08-27:** Remote is `https://github.com/barbarosisik/prostate-lab-trajectories.git`, branch is `main`, working tree was clean before this documentation update, and HEAD matched remote commit `d02eed8359229d19008efb60ba60a4cb3c08e903`.

**Retired copy pending exact cleanup review:** `C:\Users\BarbarosIsikGreenhou\Documents\Codex\2026-08-24\s\prostate-lab-trajectories` still exists and must not be used for new work. It may contain local-only literature files and an older dirty working tree. Do not delete it until its exact contents are compared and the user receives an exact deletion list with a fresh action-time confirmation.

**Authorization boundary:** The user explicitly authorized publishing the current permitted project files and deleting the former local folder in the 2026-08-25 migration session. Future commits, pushes, history changes or repository-setting changes still require fresh explicit authorization.

## Core feasibility questions that remain unanswered

1. What are the exact columns and data types in the received dictionary and CSV files?
2. What is the complete laboratory-test list by trial?
3. How many patients have at least 2, 3 and 4 valid measurement days for each test?
4. Are exact chemotherapy administration dates present anywhere?
5. Can each lab measurement be linked to the next actual chemotherapy administration?
6. Are dose, cycle, reduction, delay or missed-cycle fields present?
7. Which survival, progression, response and treatment-tolerance outcomes are present and dated?
8. Does the current final-scoring package reveal useful ENTHUSE-33 longitudinal data or outcomes?
9. Are units and test names consistent enough for cross-trial use?
10. Are patient joins unique and complete across all tables?

No cleaning specification or scientific conclusion may be finalized before these questions are answered from the actual files.

## Execution plan from the current point

### Stage 1: Acquire the approved package

**Trigger:** User is home or has authorized protected storage.

**Actions:**

1. Remind the user to sign in to PDS.
2. Open the approved DREAM contribution.
3. Manually download `AllProvidedFiles_149.zip`.
4. Confirm the actual completed file path and size.
5. Check available storage before copying or extracting.
6. Review any download terms or restrictions shown by PDS.

**Completion evidence:** A real file exists at a verified path and has a nonzero size.

### Stage 2: Securely verify the package

**Actions:**

1. Calculate SHA-256.
2. Record filename, timestamp, size, source page and checksum in a non-sensitive acquisition record.
3. List ZIP members without extraction.
4. Reject absolute paths, parent-directory paths and other unsafe ZIP members.
5. Confirm expected dictionary and CSV names.
6. Extract only into ignored `data/raw/pds_dream/extracted/` after path validation.

**Completion evidence:** Safe member list, checksum and expected files verified.

### Stage 3: Inspect the official dictionary

**Actions:**

1. Read every dictionary sheet.
2. Record table, column, type, meaning, missing-value code, unit and timing definition.
3. Map documented fields to the field-coverage checklist.
4. Keep unknown or contradictory definitions explicit.

**Completion evidence:** Column-level dictionary audit with no patient values.

### Stage 4: Run the safe inventory

**Actions:**

1. Run the existing synthetic tests first.
2. Run `src/audit/inventory_raw_data.py` on the extracted CSV directory.
3. Save aggregate JSON only to ignored interim storage.
4. Check that no patient identifiers or result values appear in the report.
5. Summarize counts in plain language for the user.

**Completion evidence:** Aggregate inventory report, verified privacy properties and test results.

### Stage 5: Make the actual-timing decision

**Decision A:** Exact administrations are available.

- Define true pre-chemotherapy windows using actual administration dates.

**Decision B:** Only visits or relative days are available.

- Use visit-based or calendar-based language.
- Do not call the results true pre-administration findings.
- Consider whether another source is required for treatment tolerance and dose timing.

**User checkpoint:** Explain the evidence simply and obtain approval before cleaning begins.

### Stage 6: Freeze the cleaning and analysis specification

Define only after the audit:

- Patient inclusion and exclusion.
- Repeated-measure minimums.
- Lab name and unit mapping.
- Missing, `NOT DONE`, detection-limit and duplicate rules.
- Timing windows and tie-breaking.
- Survival and censoring definitions.
- Progression, response and treatment-tolerance definitions.
- Leakage prevention.
- Trial split and validation policy.

### Stage 7: Implement cleaning and quality checks

- Preserve raw files unchanged.
- Create reproducible derived tables.
- Add tests for joins, units, time ordering, duplicates and no-future-data rules.
- Produce missingness and data-quality reports.
- Do not publish patient-level outputs.

### Stage 8: Describe all usable laboratory trajectories

- Count and plot every usable value.
- Report starting level, changes, slopes, acceleration and instability where measurement counts support them.
- Explain sparse or unusable tests instead of silently dropping them.

### Stage 9: Discovery modeling

- Test each value against survival, disease progression, treatment response and treatment tolerance.
- Begin with interpretable models.
- Test combinations only after individual signals and data quality are understood.
- Compare earliest usable landmarks after treatment periods 1, 2, 3 and 4.
- Report uncertainty and multiplicity control.

### Stage 10: Controlled broadening and validation

- Request or obtain CHAARTED linked submissions.
- Rebuild longitudinal PSA features and test compatible findings.
- Select Vivli or Flatiron only after exact variables are confirmed.
- Freeze definitions before independent validation.
- Report successful, failed, source-specific and unresolved findings.

## Decision gates

| Gate | Evidence required | If evidence is absent |
|---|---|---|
| Package obtained | File exists, size verified, checksum recorded | Stop and resolve download/storage |
| Dictionary verified | All sheets and columns inspected | Do not write cleaning rules |
| Patient joins valid | Key uniqueness and unmatched counts known | Do not merge tables |
| Repeated labs sufficient | Counts by trial, test and patient | Restrict or describe sparse tests |
| Actual chemotherapy timing | Verified administration field and linkage | Use honest visit/calendar terminology |
| Outcomes available | Exact fields, definitions and timing | Narrow outcome claims |
| Cleaning frozen | Written rules and tests approved | Do not model |
| Internal validation ready | Trial/source split and leakage checks | Do not present performance as reliable |
| External source compatible | Column-level coverage confirmed | Do not purchase or request blindly |

## Reminder queue

### Highest priority reminder

Before real-file inspection:

> Explain and approve the private Google Cloud computing environment, its cost, access controls and shutdown procedure. Do not extract or inspect the restricted package in ordinary local or shared storage.

### After cloud computing is approved

- Verify the private compute identity can read only the approved bucket and object.
- Extract in protected cloud storage only after ZIP path checks are repeated there.
- Read every dictionary sheet before creating cleaning rules.
- Run tests and the aggregate inventory before cleaning.
- Verify that the aggregate report contains no patient identifiers or laboratory values.

### Later reminders

- Explain timing feasibility to the user before cleaning.
- Ask for approval before finalizing outcome definitions.
- Request CHAARTED only after the PDS coverage gaps are known.
- Consider Vivli or Flatiron only after CHAARTED and PDS compatibility are clear.
